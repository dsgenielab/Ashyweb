	 <h1>Sandra's Story</h1> 
	 <h2>This is the story of a time my best friend Sandra was struck by lighting on her way to Burger King</h2>

	 <p>On a warm and muddy day in July, Sandra was walking from a volleyball tournament. Her team performed the best ever, and ended up deadlast. While this was disappointing, she was happy that she did her best and wasn't benched like she usually is. After, a long and active day, Sandra could never stop dreaming about onion rings and a whopper - her favorite consolation prize after a loss.</p>        

	 <p>When she got close to the <a href = "https://www.burgerking.ca/?lang=en&locale-selected=1%C2%AEion=CA&gclid=CjwKCAjwzJmlBhBBEiwAEJyLu_NEoWCe-15aoIRi3cnQewaxFPBmtT-cNIXtkIbYZ_8g7unnxBHFrhoCKwYQAvD_BwE">restaurant</a>, she made a list in her mind to get:</p>

	 <ul>
	 	<li>Onion rings</li>
	 	<li>Sprite</li>
	 	<li>Whopper</li>
	 </ul>

	 <p>She also decided to get herself a crown! She also thought to herself: I have some samosas waiting for me at home, so I won't buy too much food</p>

	 <p>However Sandra never got to Burger King. The last we hear from her is when she texted her brother John to ask that he meet her there ar 4PM. It is now 5:15 and she is nowhere to be found.</p>
